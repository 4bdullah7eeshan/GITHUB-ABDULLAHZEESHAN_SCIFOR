# Mini Project 01

As part of our first Mini Project, we were tasked to create a website for an online store.

### About

[BakeNest](https://zeeshan777.github.io/GITHUB-ABDULLAHZEESHAN_SCIFOR/mini-project-01/bakenest/) is a mockup of an online cake store created majorly with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

### Reflections

This was my first time toying around with Bootstrap. It was fun exploring the various classes it had to offer. The toughest part of the project was making the site Responsive. Althoug, I have managed to do so for mobiles, tabs, and PCs, I have realized that I have a long way to go.
