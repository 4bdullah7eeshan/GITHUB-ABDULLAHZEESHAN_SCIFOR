    <h1>Freedom: A Poem by Rabindranath Tagore</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Freedom from fear is the freedom</p>
    <p>I claim for you my motherland!</p>
    <p>Freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,</p>
    <p>breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning</p>
    <p>call of the future;</p>
    <p>Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith</p>
    <p>you fasten yourself in night's stillness,</p>
    <p>mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;</p>
    <p>freedom from the anarchy of destiny</p>
    <p>whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,</p>
    <p>and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.</p>
    <p>Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,</p>
    <p>where movements are started through brainless wires,</p>
    <p>repeated through mindless habits,</p>
    <p>where figures wait with patience and obedience for the</p>
    <p>master of show,</p>
    <p>to be stirred into a mimicry of life.</p>
