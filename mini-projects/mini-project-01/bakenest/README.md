## About

As part of our first Mini Project, we were tasked to create a website for an online store. 

Say Hello to **[BakeNest](https://zeeshan777.github.io/GITHUB-ABDULLAHZEESHAN_SCIFOR/mini-projects/mini-project-01/bakenest/)**!

[BakeNest](https://zeeshan777.github.io/GITHUB-ABDULLAHZEESHAN_SCIFOR/mini-projects/mini-project-01/bakenest/) is a mockup of an online cake store created majorly with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Learning Reflections

This was my first time toying around with Bootstrap. It was fun exploring the various classes it had to offer. The toughest part of the project was making the site Responsive. The site is responsive on mobiles, tabs, and PCs.
