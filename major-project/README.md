## Background

As part of concluding the Frontend Development training, we were asked to create a major project of our choice.

I picked a **[CV Builder Application](https://cv-application-plum-chi.vercel.app/)** with React.

## About

The CV application aims to provide users with a platform to create and manage their CVs easily. The application allows users to input personal details, education, experience, skills, and projects. It also offers PDF generation capabilities, ensuring that users can export their CVs for professional use.
